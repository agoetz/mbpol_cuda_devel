* This is the tester file for a simple two_layer NN model, 
* generating the same forward calculation of a fully_connected layer + ReLU non_linety and a fully connected layer + softmax activation
*
* It uses the same input and weighted matrix as in Python script.
* Inputs and weights are saved in "layer_toy_param.dat" which is loaded directly
